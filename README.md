# ðŸ“˜ AOA Lab Programs in C++

This repository contains simple and beginner-friendly C++ implementations of common **Analysis of Algorithms (AOA)** lab problems. Each program is written to be easy to understand, and uses default input values for quick testing (no user input required).

## âœ… What's Included

| # | Algorithm | Technique |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Selection Sort | Sorting |
| 2 | Merge Sort | Divide and Conquer |
| 4.1 | Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm | Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) |
| 4.2 | Prim's Algorithm | Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) |
| 5 | Floyd-Warshall Algorithm | All-Pairs Shortest Path |
| 6 | Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) | Dynamic Programming |
| 7 | N-Queens Problem | Backtracking |
| 9 | Naive String Matching | Pattern Matching |
